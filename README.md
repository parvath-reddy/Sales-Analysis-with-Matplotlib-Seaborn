# ðŸ›’Sales Data Analysis with Matplotlib & Seaborn

##  Project Overview
This project is a **simple end-to-end data analysis workflow** using synthetic sales data.  
It simulates a small retail dataset and demonstrates how to:
- Clean missing values
- Engineer new features
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize insights using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**

The dataset includes:
- Products: Laptop, T-Shirt, Rice Bag, Novel  
- Regions: North, South, East, West  
- Order details: Price, Quantity, Discounts, Dates

##  Visualizations
The project covers multiple plots:
1. **Correlation Heatmap** â€“ relationships between numerical features  
2. **Boxplot** â€“ revenue distribution across products  
3. **Scatterplot** â€“ price vs revenue, broken down by region  
4. **Category-Region Heatmap** â€“ revenue patterns across product categories and regions  
5. **Monthly Revenue Trend** â€“ bar chart of total revenue by month

##  Tools Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** â€“ data manipulation  
- **NumPy** â€“ numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** â€“ visualization  
- **Seaborn** â€“ advanced plots
